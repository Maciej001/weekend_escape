#Weekend Escape 
Weekend Escape is the easiest way to escape London for weekend.
Based on the weather, temperature, flight time and hotel rating it enables you to browse available weekend travel offers.

Due to time constraint project was simplified to maximum, to present my idea in form of working Meteor app.

App has admin panel, that is not exposed to the user. It enables:
1. Downloading current weather
2. Generates list of cities
3. Downloads flight prices from London (out: Friday, return: Sunday)
4. Downloads hotel rates for list of cities
